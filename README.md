## Introduction
**philosophers** is a project about managing multiple threads in the same program. In this project, we learn how to use threads, how to make them waiting or using shared variables.

Here, each thread is a philosopher, who has to eat to survive. When a philosopher can't eat soon enough, he dies, and the simulation stops.

## Rules
<pre>- One or more philosophers sit at a round table. There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
- The philosophers alternatively <b>eat<b>, <b>think<b>, or <b>sleep<b>.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
